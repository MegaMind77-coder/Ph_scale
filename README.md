This project is a simple rendition of the classes property in CSS.

This project aims to potray a colourful representation of the Ph scale, widely used in Chemistry to determine the acidity/alkalinity of a solution.


At 25 degrees, pH typically ranges from 0 to 14; 7 being the neutral point.

If concentration (in eq./L) of [H+] is x N, pH is -log(x)/log(10).





There are three main files:

1. styles.css; an external style sheet demonstrating the uses of Classes in CSS.
2. index.html; the base HTML file used to display the pH scale.
3. calculate.py; a file which takes in Concentration of [H+] and prints out pH.
